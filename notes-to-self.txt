1. in most cases, avoiding N^2 time/space complexity is possible.
	ways to reduce complexity:
		- use the first/last/a special element in a list in a smart way
		- approach the list from both sides
        - consider using 2 pointers

2. edge cases with strings:
	- one string is larger than the other in a way that does not make sense.
	- the strings are the same size

3. edge cases with arrays:
    - empty array
    - single element array
    - if you're ever forward-looking in an array (list[i+1])
        make sure you have safeguards in place to avoid array out of bounds error

3. implementing binary search:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums)-1
        while l <= r:
            m = (l+r)//2
            if nums[m] == target:
                return m
            if nums[m] < target:
                l = m + 1
            if nums[m] > target:
                r = m - 1
        
		# executes if target not found, returns which index the target would have been
        return (m if nums[m] > target else m+1)
