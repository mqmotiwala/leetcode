1. in most cases, avoiding N^2 time/space complexity is possible.
	ways to reduce complexity:
		- use the first/last/a special element in a list in a smart way
		- approach the list from both sides

2. edge cases with strings:
	- one string is larger than the other in a way that does not make sense.
	- the strings are the same size
